    "## Problem Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project involves replicating an experiment similar to Ronald Fisher's famous tea-tasting experiment. In the original experiment, Dr. Muriel Bristol claimed she could tell whether milk or tea was poured first into a cup, and Fisher designed a hypothesis test to see if she was just guessing or if she could truly tell the difference. In this version of the experiment, we test STA130 students to see if they can correctly identify whether milk or tea was poured first. We sampled 80 students, and 49 of them correctly identified the order.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relationship Between This Experiment and Fisher's Original Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "In Fisher’s original experiment, the population of interest was Dr. Muriel Bristol's ability to discern whether milk or tea was poured first. The experiment was designed to see if her correct responses could be explained by random guessing. Similarly, in this experiment, we are testing whether the 49 correct responses from 80 STA130 students could be explained by random guessing. The difference is that this experiment involves a larger sample size and a less personal context (Bristol was one person with a specific claim, while here we sample many students from a general population).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statements of the Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (\\( H_0 \\))**: The STA130 students are randomly guessing whether the tea or milk was poured first. Formally, the null hypothesis assumes the probability of a correct guess is 0.5, or \\( p = 0.5 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (\\( H_A \\))**: The STA130 students are not just guessing; they have some ability to correctly identify whether tea or milk was poured first. Formally, this implies that \\( p > 0.5 \\), where \\( p \\) is the proportion of correct responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantitative Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "To test this hypothesis, we need to perform a **one-sample proportion test**. We will compare the observed proportion of students who correctly identified the order (49/80) to the null hypothesis proportion (0.5).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observed Test Statistic**: The observed proportion of correct answers is \\( \\hat{p} = \\frac{49}{80} = 0.6125 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis Proportion**: Under the null hypothesis, \\( p = 0.5 \\), meaning that if students are guessing, we expect half of them to be correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to determine if the observed proportion of 0.6125 is significantly greater than 0.5, which would suggest that students are not simply guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Findings and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the Z-test for proportions, we will compare the p-value to a significance level (commonly \\( \\alpha = 0.05 \\)). If the p-value is smaller than the significance level, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that students are not just guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Interpretation:\n",
    "- If the **p-value is very small** (e.g., less than 0.05), it suggests that the observed result (49 correct answers) would be very unlikely to occur if students were simply guessing. This would provide evidence against the null hypothesis and suggest that students can correctly identify the order of tea and milk more often than by chance.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- If the **p-value is larger than 0.05**, we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis, meaning the results are consistent with students randomly guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion Regarding the Null Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the outcome of the Z-test, we will either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If the p-value is small**, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that STA130 students seem to have some ability to correctly identify the order of tea and milk.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **If the p-value is large**, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, meaning the evidence suggests that students are likely guessing, and there is no significant ability to correctly identify the order.\n"
